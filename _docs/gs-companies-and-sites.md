## zira entities hierarchy

Zira allows you to create a virtual twin of an actual organization and assets

**Typical zira project will use the below hierarchy for modeling:**
-  Company
    - Site 1
      - Channel 1
      - channel 2
      - ...
    - Site 2
      - Channel 1
      - channel 2
      - ... 
    - ...

- Company resemble the higher organization hierarchy (for example,  brand name like "Coca-Cola" or "McDonald's" )
- Site resemble physical facilities under the company (for example,  buildings, factories, offices, etc.)
- Channels resemble assets within a site (for example, teams, machines, production lines, warehouses, utility, and anything that requires specific people to interact over specific data)
