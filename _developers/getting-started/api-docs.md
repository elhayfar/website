The best way to play and experience with zira API (before diving into code) is by using our [postman collection](https://apidocs.zira.us).
We recommend working with postman desktop version see [Download Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)


The API collection contains the documentation including examples and code snippets of each API:


1. Browse to [https://apidocs.zira.us/](https://apidocs.zira.us)
2. Click **Run in Postman** on the top right corner of the page
3. Install postman


## Testing the APIs
